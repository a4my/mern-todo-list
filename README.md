# My Todo List ✏️📝✔️

This repository contains the files of one of my MERN projects. This is a MERN todo list where users can register and use their own todo lists.

Users can register and login to access their dashboard as well as creating and tracking todo items which can also be edited, deleted or toggled between completed and incompleted status.

## What I used 🔨
What I wanted to do with this todo list projects was to use the MongoDB database and Express server to create a more complex todo list app.

## Extra learning ✔
Along the way, I picked up more knowledge about Express, MongoDB and React such as using the context API and some new hooks. 

## Responsiveness 📱
This project is responsive on any devices.
